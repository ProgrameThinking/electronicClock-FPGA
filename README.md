# electronicClock-FPGA

In the project of electronic clock system developed based on FPGA technology, I was responsible for leading the design and implementation of several key functions, including:

## Time display and control

Using FPGA to control a 7-segment digital tube to support accurate time display and update in 12-hour and 24-hour systems.

## Alarm Clock and Whole Time Chime Functions

Design and implement multiple alarm clock functions, allowing users to set multiple alarm times.

Configure the system to chime at the whole hour to enhance user experience and practicality.

## User Interaction and Setup

Utilize the matrix keypad to interact with the FPGA and develop responsive interface and logic to ensure user-friendly time and alarm setting functions.

## Alarm Function:

Integrate audio module to play preset ditty as alarm reminder function, realize alarm trigger and stop control to ensure timely and effective reminder function.

## Counter function:

Develop and optimize 60 and 24-bit counters to meet specific application scenarios and timing needs, write precise counting logic to ensure the accuracy and reliability of counting.

## Technology Stack & Tools:

Write Hardware Description Language (HDL) code in VHDL, and utilize Xilinx development boards for hardware development, debugging, and verification.

Simulation and verification using timing analysis tools such as ModelSim to ensure the stability and functional integrity of the hardware circuits.
